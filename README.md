Memory Game - A Python Project for Beginners

It's a python game base on PyGame library to show how to use this library and implement that instructure with a funny game.
In this game you hame to clik on any cards to unhide the face of them and find another pair of that card. 
To be more difficulty the cards rotate 90,180 or 270 degrees . 
As a python developer you can find out how to call and show images, working with lists and mouse click handling.
I hope you enjoy it.
